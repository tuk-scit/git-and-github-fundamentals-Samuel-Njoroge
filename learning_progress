# GIT
Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS), which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing.
**Repositories**
A repository is where your project work happens--think of it as your project folder. It contains all of your projectâ€™s files and revision history.
